## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at [Defense Unicorns](defenseunicorns.com). I enjoy everything Kubernetes and building solutions that solve for real and meaningful missions.

I advocate for open source and am working to actively contribute to projects and core functionality that drives improvements for underrepresented use-cases.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Zarf](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf) for Secure Software Delivery - from connected to disconnected.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on securing, attestation and provenance around kubernetes workloads.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about #airgap,

## Hobbies
Outside of Software and Open Source contributions, I enjoy a variety of other activities. I am an active Volunteer Ground Search and Rescue responder for Snohomish County Volunteer Search and Rescue. 

### Literature
I attempt to split my progress on reading books into two categories - current reading list:
- Professional development: Extreme Ownership - Jocko Willink/Leif Babin
- Personal fun: Oathbringer - Stormlight Archives Book 3 - Brandon Sanderson

### Fitness
